## Pyramid-focus-augmentation: medical image segmentation withstep-wise focus

We introduce a novel augmentation technique called **pyramid-focus-augmentation** which can be used to improve the performance of polyps segmentation task when we have a small dataset to train DL models. In addition to that, our method can focus doctors' attention to regions of polyps gradually. This technique can be applied to any segmentation task with any deep learning model using to do segmentation.
