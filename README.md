# Pyramid-focus-augmentation: medical image segmentation withstep-wise focus (PYRA)
We introduce a novel augmentation technique called pyramid-focus-augmentation which can be used to improve the performance of polyps segmentation task when we have a small dataset to train DL models. In addition to that, our method can focus doctorsâ€™ attention to regions of polyps gradually. This technique can be applied to any segmentation task with any deep learning model using to do segmentation.
